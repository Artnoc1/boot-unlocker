== !BootUnlocker for Galaxy Nexus -- Unlock your bootloader without fastboot. ==


This application *REQUIRES* a Galaxy Nexus (_maguro_, _toro_ or _toroplus_) with root.

--------

_!BootUnlocker for Galaxy Nexus_ avoids using `fastboot oem unlock`, with its associated
`userdata` wipe by writing directly to the `param` partition of your device's internal storage.
The _PRIMELA03_ bootloader stores the lock status at position` 0x000007C` (124 decimal)
of this partition: fastboot updates this when locking and unlocking the bootloader.
   
_!BootUnlocker_ uses root privileges to write to that location directly, bypassing fastboot.
This allows you to lock and unlock your bootloader from within
Android, without wiping your `userdata` partition.


The technique used was discovered through the efforts of several contributors on
[http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1650830&page=13 an XDA thread].
Special thanks go to those who posted raw images of their `param` partitions for
analysis (
