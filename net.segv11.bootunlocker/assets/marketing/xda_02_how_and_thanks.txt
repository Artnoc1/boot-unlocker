[I]BootUnlocker for Galaxy Nexus[/I] avoids using "fastboot oem unlock", with its associated "userdata" wipe by writing directly to the "param" partition of your device's internal storage. The [I]PRIMELA03[/I] bootloader stores the lock status at position [U]0x000007C[/U] (124 decimal) of this partition: fastboot updates this when locking and unlocking the bootloader.
   
[I]BootUnlocker[/I] uses root privileges to write to that location directly, bypassing fastboot. This allows you to lock and unlock your bootloader from within Android, without wiping your "userdata" partition.


The technique used was discovered through the efforts of several contributors on another XDA thread: [URL]http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1650830&page=13[/URL]

Special thanks go to those who posted raw images of their "param" partitions for analysis (Archpope, AdamOutler, efrant, NCguy, Raftysworld, and others)  as well as to the beta testers of this application (efrant, Mach3.2, Meep70, and others). This application could not have been written without their contributions.
