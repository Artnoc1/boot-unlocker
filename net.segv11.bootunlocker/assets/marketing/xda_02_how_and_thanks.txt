[I]BootUnlocker for Nexus Devices[/I] avoids using "fastboot oem unlock", with its associated "userdata" wipe. When fastboot unlocks it updates a lock status flag, stored on a partition of your device's internal storage. Device partitions, positions and state values (locked/unlocked) are as follows:

On the Galaxy Nexus, the bootloader uses at position [U]0x000007C[/U] (124 decimal) of the "param" partition, stored as 01 / 00.
On the Nexus 10, the bootloader uses position [U]0x0000224[/U] (548 decimal) of the "param" partition, stored as 00 / 01.
On the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5, the bootloaders use position [U]0x0004010[/U] (16400 decimal) of the "misc" partition, stored as 00 / 01.
On the Nexus 7 (2013), the bootloader uses position [U]0x04FFC00[/U] (5241856 decimal) of the "aboot" parition, stored as 00 / 02.
 
The Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 bootloaders also keep a "Tamper" flag at position [U]0x0004014[/U] (16404 decimal) of the "misc" parition. It is stored as 00 / 01 (untampered/tampered), and can be viewed using "fastboot oem device-info". [I]BootUnlocker for Nexus Devices[/I] can set and clear this flag too.

   
[I]BootUnlocker[/I] uses root privileges to write to to the appropriate location directly, bypassing fastboot. This allows you to lock and unlock your bootloader from within Android, without wiping your "userdata" partition.

The technique used was discovered through the efforts of several contributors on another XDA thread: [URL]http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1650830&page=13[/URL]

Special thanks go to those who posted raw images of their device partitions, helped with/conducted the analysis, or put their devices in harm's way to beta test: efrant, osm0sis, iuss, Archpope, AdamOutler, NCguy, Raftysworld, Mach3.2, Meep70, and others. This application could not have been written without their contributions.
