_BootUnlocker for Galaxy Nexus_ avoids using "fastboot oem unlock", with its associated
"userdata" wipe by writing directly to the "param" partition of your device's internal storage.
The _PRIMELA03_ bootloader stores the lock status at position 0x000007C (124 decimal)
of this partition: fastboot updates this when locking and unlocking the bootloader.
   
_BootUnlocker_ uses root privileges to write to that location directly, bypassing fastboot.
This allows you to lock and unlock your bootloader from within
Android, without wiping your "userdata" partition.


The technique used was discovered through the efforts of several contributors on
another XDA thread:

Special thanks go to those who posted raw images of their "param" partitions for
analysis (Archpope, AdamOutler, efrant, NCguy, and Raftysworld) 
as well as to the beta testers of this application (efrant and Mach3.2).
This application could not have been written without their contributions.
